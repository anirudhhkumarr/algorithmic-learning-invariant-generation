algorithmic-learning-invariant-generation
=========================================

This is an implementation of the paper "Deriving Invariants by Algorithmic Learning, Decision Procedures, and Predicate Abstraction" by Yungbum Jung , Soonho Kong , Bow-Yaw Wang , and Kwangkeun Yi.

This is not a working code and code for concretization of boolean formulae has to be added in order to make it work. I have implemented the basic algorithm, utilities and representation of invariants.
